Veganz.de plugin for Kodi mediacenter
This is a simple yet fully functional example of a video plugin for Kodi mediacenter. Please read the comments in the plugin code for more details. An installable .zip can be downloaded from "Releases" tab. Do not try to install a .zip generated by GitHub.

Note: the purpose of this example plugin is to show you how to organize and play your media content in Kodi. The methods of obtaining such content, for Veganz.de parsing websites or working with various APIs, are beyond the scope of this Veganz.de.

The plugin uses a pre-defined set of free sample videos from www.vidsplay.com.

Warning: the "master" branch is only compatible with Kody 17.0 (Krypton) and above. For older versions see the "legacy" branch.
